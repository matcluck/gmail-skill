# Gmail Colour Labels

Use this companion workflow to apply Gmail label colours safely. Also load and follow the core `gmail` skill at `../gmail/SKILL.md` for browser setup, sequential Gmail automation, state dumps, safety rules, and cleanup expectations.

The core `gmail` skill should reference this skill as its label-colour entrypoint.

## Required Inputs

- `../gmail/SKILL.md`
- `../gmail/references/core/dump-state.js`
- `../gmail/references/labels/set-label-color.js`
- Current Gmail labels from settings before making changes

## Workflow

1. Open Gmail with the browser setup from the core `gmail` skill and navigate to the label sidebar or `#settings/labels` as needed.
2. Dump current labels before making changes. Do not persist or commit raw Gmail exports, account emails, or personal label lists.
3. Read `../gmail/references/labels/set-label-color.js` before applying colours.
   - Prefer its `setLabelColorsOverCDP({ cdpUrl, updates })` helper for batch updates when Chromium remote debugging is available.
   - Use `setLabelColor(page, labelName, rgb)` only for one-off or fallback changes.
4. If the user supplied an explicit label-to-colour mapping, apply that mapping exactly, using only Gmail preset RGB values.
5. If the user asked for automatic or standardized colouring, propose a compact mapping first unless the requested policy is already explicit.
   - When preserving an existing parent label colour, still include uncoloured child labels under that parent in the proposed batch so the subtree stays visually consistent.
6. Apply colours sequentially inside one browser session. Prefer one scripted batch over many MCP hover/click calls when possible.
7. Verify by rechecking visible labels or settings state after changes.

Do not create, rename, move, delete, archive, mark read, unsubscribe, or change filters unless the user separately asks. This skill is only for label colours.

## Default Colour Policy

Use Gmail preset colours only. Prefer stable category intent over sender/product branding:

| Intent | RGB |
|---|---|
| Security, login, MFA, account protection | `251, 76, 47` |
| Finance, bills, tax, banking | `22, 167, 101` |
| Purchases, deliveries, receipts | `255, 117, 55` |
| Travel, events, bookings | `73, 134, 231` |
| Work, projects, tools | `45, 162, 187` |
| Personal, community, family | `185, 154, 255` |
| Newsletters, marketing, low-priority subscriptions | `194, 194, 194` |
| Reference, archives, neutral system mail | `231, 231, 231` |

When a label path has parent and child labels, colour only the requested label by default. If Gmail asks whether to apply a parent colour to sublabels, choose the option for the named label only unless the user explicitly requested inheritance.

## Safety Notes

- Ask before bulk recolouring existing labels when no exact mapping was provided.
- Preserve user-assigned colours for labels that are outside the approved mapping.
- If a requested colour is not a Gmail preset, choose the nearest preset and mention the substitution.
- If a label cannot be found, stop and re-dump labels before retrying. Do not guess renamed or nested labels.
